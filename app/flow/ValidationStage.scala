/*
 * Custom Akka streaming flow graph stage that validates each row by calling RowValidator.validate on it.
 * The stage receives a stream of unvalidated rows.
 * For each input row it outputs a validation outcome, which is simply either just the incoming row
 * (if validation succeeded) or the validation errors (if validation failed)
 *
 * As a custom stage it can safely maintain mutable state, in this case it
 * keeps track of the row number for inclusion in validation error details
